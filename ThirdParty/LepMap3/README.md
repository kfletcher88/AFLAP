# Obtaining LepMap3.

LepMap3 is the current, recommended way to run the final stages of AFLAP. The scripts used to run AFLAP will expect to find the bin directory here. This can be done by running `./LM3dload.sh`.

Alternatively. A link to the ./bin of a different installation of LepMap3 could be provided here.

Finally, the supplementary scripts `LepMap3SeperateChromosomes.pl` and `LepMap3OrderMarkers.pl` can be provided with a directory in which to find LepMap3, by using the `-d` flag. Their default behaviour is to look here.

For more details regarding [LepMap3, please visit the Sourceforge website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lep-map3/) or see the [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx494).
